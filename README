INTERESTING NOTE re: cython compilation

So, distutils options are defined directly in the source files, however,
include paths seem to have to be relative to the install directory, thus, 
in ./ssf_DTS_caller/c_hierarchical_edge_merge.pyx, I define my sources as:

# distutils: sources = ./ssf_DTS_caller/heap/heap.cc

a bit wierd...
